Running in Visual Studio:

1. Build the Project:

2. Start Debugging:

Press F5 or click the "Start Debugging" button in the toolbar.
The API will start running, typically on https://localhost:5001 (or a specified port).
3. Test Endpoints:

Use a REST client (e.g., Postman, curl) to make requests to the API endpoints.
Provide authentication headers for protected endpoints.
Observe responses and logs to verify functionality.
Additional Considerations:

Consider using a database for persistent data storage.
Explore advanced features like input validation, filtering, and pagination.
Implement security measures like input sanitization and rate limiting.
Deploy the API to a hosting environment for production use.
